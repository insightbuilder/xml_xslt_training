<xsl:apply-templates> and <xsl:for-each> are both used in XSLT for processing XML data, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors. 
Here's a comparison of the two:

Purpose:

<xsl:apply-templates>: It's used to apply templates to elements in the XML document based
 on their matching patterns. It's a way to trigger template processing for elements that match 
 specific criteria.

<xsl:for-each>: It's used for explicit iteration through a selected set of elements 
in the XML document. It's typically used when you want to process a set of elements 
sequentially without relying on template matching.

Usage:

<xsl:apply-templates>: You specify the elements to be processed indirectly by defining templates with 
matching patterns for those elements. The XSLT processor applies the appropriate template for 
each matching element it encounters.

<xsl:for-each>: You specify the elements to be processed explicitly by selecting them using
 XPath expressions. The XSLT processor processes each selected element in sequence.

Behavior:

<xsl:apply-templates>: It relies on template matching and is more flexible. 
It allows you to define templates for various elements in your XML and 
have them applied automatically when those elements are encountered during processing.

<xsl:for-each>: It explicitly iterates through the selected 
elements in the order they appear in the document. 
It's useful when you want to perform sequential processing of
 elements that may not necessarily have distinct templates 
 associated with them.
